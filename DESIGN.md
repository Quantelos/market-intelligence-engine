## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
A premium, futuristic fintech aesthetic featuring a dark mode glassmorphism style with high-contrast glowing neon accents. It should feel institutional-grade, cutting-edge, and highly technical.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Background**: Deep Void Black (#06080F) with subtle radial glowing orbs (like #1A1230)
- **Surface**: Glassmorphic cards (semi-transparent #FFFFFF0A) with sharp, thin 1px borders (#FFFFFF1A) and heavy background blur
- **Primary Accent**: Neon Cyber Purple (#9D4EDD) for main CTA buttons and active states
- **Secondary Accent**: Electric Teal (#00F5D4) for data visualizations, trend lines, and success metrics
- **Text Primary**: Crisp White (#FFFFFF) for high-contrast readability on deep backgrounds
- **Text Secondary**: Cool Steel Gray (#94A3B8) for supporting copy and descriptions

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Family**: Modern, technical geometric sans-serif font (like Inter, Space Grotesk, or Satoshi)
- **Style**: High-contrast, clean readability. Vibrant gradient text for key headlines.

## 4. Component Stylings
- **Cards/Containers**: Glassmorphic (semi-transparent backgrounds, heavy blur), sharp thin 1px borders (#FFFFFF1A).

## 5. Layout Principles
- **Effects**: Subtle glowing drop shadows on interactive elements. Floating 3D-angled glassmorphic elements for showcase representations.
